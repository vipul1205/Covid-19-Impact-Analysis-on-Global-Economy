The Covid-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruptions to 
the global economy, with far-reaching consequences for businesses, 
governments, and societies. Understanding the multifaceted impacts of the 
pandemic on the global economy is crucial for informed decision-making and 
policy planning. This study presents an in-depth analysis of the Covid-19 impact 
on the global economy, focusing on key economic indicators such as GDP, HDI, 
and Stringency index. We utilize a comprehensive dataset comprising of 
historical economic data from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic periods, along 
with relevant socio-economic variables. We employ statistical analysis, 
econometric models, and data visualization techniques to examine the 
magnitude, duration, and distribution of the Covid-19 impact across different 
countries, regions. We also explore the role of various factors, such as 
government policies, healthcare measures, and global supply chains, in shaping 
the economic impact of the pandemic. Our analysis provides valuable insights 
into the dynamic and evolving nature of the Covid-19 impact on the global 
economy. These findings can inform policymakers, businesses, and 
stakeholders in developing strategies to mitigate the economic effects of the 
pandemic, support recovery, and build resilience for the future. This study 
contributes to the understanding of the unprecedented challenges posed by 
the pandemic to the global economy and highlights the need for robust policy 
responses and adaptive strategies in the post-pandemic era.
